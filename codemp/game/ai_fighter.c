AI pilots for the empty ships of the space maps (mp/siege_destroyer2 and the like): the MP version of the singleplayer
AI_Fighter.cpp

A map's ship spawners (NPC_Vehicle with a "teamowner") make the ships of two sides, team 1 (red: the Rebels on
siege_destroyer2) and team 2 (blue: the Empire). The players of a side fly its ships; the ones they leave standing in
the hangar can get an AI pilot (G_FighterAI_Frame), so the battle is never empty. A side always keeps enough empty
ships for its players who are not flying one: an AI pilot only gets in when the side has more empty ships than that,
and only up to g_spaceWingmen AI ships for team 1 and g_spaceEnemies for team 2. A ship that is lost and comes back
stays empty when a player needs it.

The pilot flies it by filling in its usercmd like a player (NPC_FighterAI, run from NPC_RunBehavior): it picks an enemy
ship, leads it and shoots when it is lined up, breaks away when too close, turns away from the Star Destroyer,
asteroids and walls ahead of it, and uses turbo and its missiles now and then. Without an enemy it flies with a player
of its side, or patrols (along the map's ship route if it has one: see "Ship routes" below).

g_spaceBattle 0 switches it off, g_spaceAISkill sets how good they are (0-3, -1: medium).

Walking to the ships (as the singleplayer AI_Fighter.cpp)

On a map with a walk file (shiproutes/<map>.walk: deathstar_trench_v1 / v2), a ship's AI pilot is not made inside
it: he is made at the hangar's pilot start point nearest to the ship ("s x y z" lines: the player spawn areas) and
walks to it along the hangar's walk points ("w x y z"), each linked to the ones he can walk straight to. Next to the
ship he gets in (Fighter_Board), and from then on the fighter AI flies it (his own AI does nothing until the ship is
gone). One who can't get there in WALK_TIMEOUT is put in it. A map without the file: the pilot is made inside the
ship, as before.

used only when its spot is empty (its last ship has flown out or is gone), so a hangar holds one ship per spot.

===========================================================================
Ship routes

Points in open space a map's ships patrol along, kept in shiproutes/<map>.route (shiproutes/mp/siege_destroyer2.route,
the same files as singleplayer's). They are made in the game, flying (or noclipping) around the map, with bot_wp_edit 1
or cheats on:

	ship_wp_add		a point where you are (your ship, if you are in one)
	ship_wp_rem		removes the point nearest to you
	ship_wp_show	shows the points and their links (on/off)
	ship_wp_info	checks the route: points in something solid or not linked, parts not joined to the rest
	ship_wp_save	writes the file
	ship_wp_load	reads it again (undoes changes not saved)
	ship_wp_clear	removes all the points

A point is linked to the nearest ones a ship can fly straight to (nothing in between), so a route never goes through
the Star Destroyer or an asteroid. A ship without an enemy flies from point to point along the links, on to the one
most ahead of it now and then another; when it has fought, it goes back to the nearest point it can see. A map
without a route file: ships patrol around where they started.
